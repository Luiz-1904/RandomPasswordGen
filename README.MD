# Random Password Generator in C#

This is a simple **Random Password Generator** created using C#. The program generates secure and customizable passwords based on user input. Users can specify the length of the password and choose which types of characters to include, such as uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

## Features

- Generates random passwords of customizable length.
- Allows the user to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Ensures at least one type of character is selected for the password.
- Simple and interactive console-based interface.

## How It Works

1. **User Input:**

   - The user is asked to provide the length of the password and select the types of characters to include.

2. **Password Generation:**

   - The program uses a `Random` number generator to randomly select characters from the allowed character sets (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols).

3. **Validation:**
   - The program ensures that at least one type of character is selected. If no types are selected, an error message is thrown.

## Customization

- **Password Length:** You can change the desired password length by modifying the input prompt.
- **Character Types:** You can customize which types of characters are included by adjusting the `if` conditions that check user input.
